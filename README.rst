Django app name translation in admin
====================================

This application allows translation of application names in the admin interface.

Works with Django 1.3.1.

Configuration and usage
-----------------------

1. Put ``app_name_translation_in_admin`` into your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` **before**
   ``django.contrib.admin``::

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
           ...
           'app_name_translation_in_admin',
           'django.contrib.admin',
           ...
        )

2. Define the app names and mark them for translations. Use title cased app
   name.

  ::

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ 

    _(u'Auth') # for auth app_name
    _(u'Sites')
    _(u'User_Addresses') # for user_addresses app_name
